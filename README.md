# E-commerce React Template 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) on a [VS code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

In this project you will get a starting point and a stepping stone towards creating an e-commerce project with the help of ReactJS library.
For starting lets clone the project and have it in our local machine . I am on Windows 10 and using VScode as editor but even on Mac or linux distro,
you don't have to worry it will work perfectly so let's go :rocket:.

### Start React project 
In VS code Press ``ctrl + J`` to get the terminal then create a folder where our project is going to sit on by ``mkdir name of folder`` then  we navigate to the path of our project folder is located by ``cd Path of folder``,
after we alive at the directory of our project you write ``npx create-react-app`` to create a new react project that we will work on,if you see the **Happy hacking** in the 
end of installation then your good to go . Now to see where we are we write ``npm start`` and the react starter page will start on the browser,now the work starts.

## Project file management
For ease of understanding we remove some files which are not needed now, which luckly they are all in ``src/``directory.
- App.Test.js
- setupTest.js
- logo.svg

It will bring an error since in the App.js there is **import** of logo.svg we remove that and we should have a blank page that means we are good to go.
